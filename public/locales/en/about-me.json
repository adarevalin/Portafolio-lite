  "intro": "A native of Puerto Asis, Putumayo, I was displaced by the armed conflict with my family. We traveled in search of a new home, and thanks to this experience, I learned to adapt to new situations and challenges. In 2018, I started my university career at the University of Pamplona. I was greatly attracted to electronic engineering due to its great versatility in areas such as communications, instrumentation and programming, allowing me to develop a great passion for technologies and their <anchorOrganizations>contribution to society</anchorOrganizations>.",
  "denouement": "During my time of study, I stood out for my performance, my curiosity to learn and a great fascination for artificial intelligence and how it is shaping today's world. Thus, I embarked on the task of doing my thesis research on how, through artificial intelligence, we can develop very accessible tools that give us optimal results. Since then, I have focused on learning more about this wonderful world of AI, both at <anchorRosario> Universidad del Rosario </anchorRosario> and on teaching platforms such as <anchorPlatzi>Platzi</anchorPlatzi>, which have provided me and incredible learning.",
